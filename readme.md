# Machine Learning: Video Object Detection
*	Objective: Detect sports balls in video footage.
*	Instructions: </br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - Generate pseudo-annotations for video data. </br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; -	Build an object detection pipeline that can train on your annotations. </br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; -	Create an evaluation procedure with visualizations of predictions and annotations. </br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -	Design a process to iteratively improve your dataset. </br>
*	Dataset: Sports-1M
*	This task is perfect for showcasing your computer vision and machine learning skills, especially if youâ€™re creative with your annotations and improvement pipeline!




# Setup
1. It is recommanded to install two separate virtual environments for ```sam2``` and ```yolov7```, please ```git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git``` and ```git clone https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7.git```  
  * For ```sam2/```, pip install pytorch first (do check compatible cuda version) before ```pip install -e ".[demo]" ```
  * For ```yolov7/```, ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. git clone our repository, take files from ```sam2/``` and ```yolov7```, move them to corresponding official sam2 and yolov7 repositories  
3. Read ```HawkEye_ML_project_report.pdf``` to learn about Pseudo-labelling and experiment setup and review.
4. Visit ```sam2/``` and run notebooks
5. Visit ```yolov7``` and run notebooks

# Results
After train on Yolov7 for few rounds of 20 epochs with only 400-600 training images, test/val 85 images, the results are shown in the following table.
